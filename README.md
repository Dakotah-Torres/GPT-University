# 🎓 AI-Powered Course & Curriculum Generators

Welcome to the **University of One**.

This project contains two powerful prompts—**Course Generator** and **Curriculum Generator**—designed to help anyone build their own personalized learning experience using ChatGPT.

Whether you're studying Data Science, Cybersecurity, Creative Writing, or any other field, these tools let you build structured, day-by-day learning paths tailored to *you*.

## 🌟 Purpose

Education has always been the path to freedom. But it’s often locked behind tuition, gatekeeping, and systems not designed for real life.

This project was built to change that.

Inspired by my experience as a self-taught learner and homeschooler—and powered by the breakthroughs in conversational AI—I created these prompts to make learning more flexible, accessible, and human.

## 🧰 What’s in This Project?

### 📘 1. Course Generator Prompt

A personalized course builder that turns ChatGPT into your private instructor.

**What It Does:**
- Builds a structured class on any subject
- Asks for your goals, time frame, learning style, and resources
- Delivers day-by-day lessons, exercises, and homework
- Adapts to your questions and gaps in understanding

**Use Case Example:**
Want to learn Python in 3 weeks, 1 hour a day, in a visual hands-on style? This prompt will walk you through that—step by step.

---

### 🎓 2. Curriculum Generator Prompt

A full career-path builder that helps you design an entire learning journey—like a bootcamp or degree plan.

**What It Does:**
- Creates a full roadmap from beginner to expert
- Customizes to your schedule, skill level, and career goals
- Includes weekly deliverables, textbook and project suggestions
- Great for switching careers, learning deeply, or planning your own “AI University”

**Use Case Example:**
Design a full 2-month Data Science bootcamp, with portfolio projects and deep learning tracks in Time Series, SQL, and Python.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Open either `Course Generator` or `Curriculum Generator`
3. Paste the prompt into ChatGPT
4. Answer the setup questions (topic, goal, time, etc.)
5. Start learning—day by day, at your pace

### 📘 Customize with External Resources

- **Have a textbook or e-book you want to learn from?**  
  You can upload or link it in ChatGPT and the Course Generator will build lessons around it.

- **Have a syllabus from a bootcamp or college course?**  
  Upload that as well! The Curriculum Generator can use it as a reference to guide your roadmap.

This gives you the flexibility to structure learning around *exactly* what you want—whether it's a specific course, certification, or subject.

That’s it. No fees, no deadlines, no pressure.

## ✨ Vision

This project started as something just for me.

I was homeschooled most of my life, and because of that, I’ve always felt comfortable taking learning into my own hands. I love being able to explore whatever I'm curious about—at my own pace, in my own way.

When people asked if I wanted to go to college, I’d usually say (only half-joking):

> “Why go to college when you can learn everything you need at the library?”

That belief pushed me to teach myself everything from coding to economics to design. But as anyone who’s tried to self-teach knows, it’s not always that simple.

I’d often hit roadblocks—maybe a paper I was reading got too dense, or a program I was writing threw an error I didn’t understand. And then came the spiral:  
🔁 Trying to find the right forum post  
🔁 Reading five articles to understand one sentence  
🔁 Realizing I needed to go back and learn something foundational  
…only to lose momentum and move on to something else.

When ChatGPT came along, everything shifted.

Now, when I get stuck, I don’t have to leave what I’m working on. I can just ask. I can say, *"Explain this part like I’m five,"* or *"Show me where I’m missing something."* And it answers—patiently, clearly, in the way I need.

That’s what made me build this.

I created tools—prompts, really—that turn ChatGPT into a mentor, a professor, and a course designer. They help me structure what I’m learning so I don’t get lost, and they meet me where I am, not where a syllabus says I should be.

I’m not building a business. I’m not trying to sell anything.  
I just believe that learning should be more accessible, more personal, and more human.

If these tools help even one person stay curious and keep learning, that’s enough for me.
